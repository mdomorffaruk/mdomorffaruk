## 🔐 About Me

I am a security-focused engineer with 6+ years of experience building and defending production-grade systems in high-risk environments.

My current specialization is **Blockchain Security and Smart Contract Auditing**, where I focus on:

* Solidity vulnerability discovery
* DeFi attack surface analysis
* Exploit reproduction & proof-of-concept validation
* Threat modeling for decentralized systems

I approach security from both sides — as a builder and as an adversarial thinker.

Security is not about running tools.

It is about understanding how systems fail, modeling adversarial behavior, and communicating risk clearly.

I build.
I break.
I secure.
